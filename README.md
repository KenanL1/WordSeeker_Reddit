# WordSeeker

WordSeeker is a fun and interactive word guessing game inspired by the party game "Codenames". There are 2 types of players: **Clue Masters** who select words to be guessed and provide a clue for them and **Word Seekers** who guess the words given the clue.

Compete with others and climb the leaderboard! Earn points when you guess all the words correctly.
